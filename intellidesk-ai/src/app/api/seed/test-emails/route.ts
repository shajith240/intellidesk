The bug: When exporting reports with more than 10,000 rows, the last 20% of data is silently dropped. This has caused us to make incorrect business decisions based on incomplete data.

I demand:
1. Immediate acknowledgment
2. A senior engineer assigned to this

If this isn't resolved by end of day, I'm escalating to your CEO and exploring legal options.

We've found a significant discrepancy between the analytics dashboard and the API responses:
- Dashboard shows 15,234 active users for this week
- API /analytics/users endpoint returns 12,891 for the same period

The difference of ~2,300 users is too large to be a timing issue. We suspect there's a bug in either the dashboard aggregation or the API query.

This impacts our board reporting. Please investigate.
